    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>ground chicken</li>
      <li>alfredo sauce</li>
      <li>ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>egg</li>
      <li>minced garlic</li>
      <li>minced onion</li>
      <li>mozzarella</li>
      <li>frozen spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large frying pan brown the meat. Crumble it into small pieces (I use a potato masher to do this) while cooking. Remove from the heat and add the alfredo sauce and 1/2 tsp salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 if baking immediately (you can also refrigerate for a day or two before baking).
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl whisk together the ricotta, egg, 1/2 tsp salt, garlic, and onion.</li>
        <li>Spread half the meat in the bottom of a large casserole dish. Top with half the ricotta and then half the spinach. Sprinkle half the mozzarella on top. Repeat the layers: meat, ricotta, spinach, and the finish with the rest of the mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes until the cheese on top is golden and bubble.
        </li>
      </ol>
