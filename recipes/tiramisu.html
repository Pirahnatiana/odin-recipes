    <h2>Tiramisu with a twist</h2>
    <p>
      This healthy tiramisu recipe is made with homemade lady fingers that are
      gluten and grain free. A super creamy and high protein dessert, this Greek
      yogurt tiramisu is made with Kaluha (or sweetened espresso) and spiced
      dark chocolate, and of course, mascarpone cheese!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>coconut flour</li>
      <li>almond flour</li>
      <li>baking soda</li>
      <li>coconut oil</li>
      <li>eggs</li>
      <li>honey</li>
      <li>vanilla</li>
      <li>greek yogurt</li>
      <li>mascarpone</li>
      <li>kahlua</li>
      <li>cocoa powder</li>
      <li>dark chocolate</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 320</li>
      <li>
        Mix the wet ingredients together in a small bowl along with the baking
        soda. Mix well to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the coconut flour and almond flour, mixing well until there are no
        clumps remaining. Do not worry about overstirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes. The coconut flour is very
        absorbent, and the batter should thicken up considerably. If after 5
        minutes the batter doesnâ€™t seem thick enough to pipe into lady fingers,
        add another tablespoon of coconut flour, mix well, and allow to sit
        another 5 minutes to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the thickened batter to a piping bag or plastic ziplock bag. Cut a
        1/2 inch slit in one corner, and pipe 2 1/2 inch long strips. Leave
        space between each one; the batter rises and spreads slightly.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
    </ol>
